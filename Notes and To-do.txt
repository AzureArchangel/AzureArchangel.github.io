Last worked on: 6/16/23
- Continued working on the Contact Me page; specifically started working on
figuring out a submit form that a potential employer or curious person 
could use to send me an email right from the "Contact Me" page on my website.

To-Do:
- Do homework assigned by Kelly
- Watch the javascript email videos that Joeseph sent
- Do further research on sending an email using javascript
- Work on more general formatting across all pages when possible
